In this repository you find the CAD data of the Passively Fed Fractionated Dipole originally by Irena Zivkovic and her team seperated in substrate and conductors.

Publication: Zivkovic, Irena; Castro, Catalina Arteaga de; Webb, Andrew (2019): Design and characterization of an eight-element passively fed meander-dipole array with improved specific absorption rate efficiency for 7 T body imaging. In: NMR in biomedicine 32 (8), e4106. DOI: 10.1002/nbm.4106.

Materials: 

- Conductor: PEC
- Substrate: FR-4(lossy), epsilon=4.3, loss tangent=0.025 at 10GHz (constant fit), thermal conductivity=0.3
